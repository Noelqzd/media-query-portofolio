homework week 3
Assignment Two Instructions - (No Bootstrap)
Copy the contents of Basic-Portfolio (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into Responsive-Portfolio.

Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the Basic-Portfolio repo.

If you chose the Wireframe exercise for your first homework assignment, talk to a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.

Inside your Responsive-Portfolio folder, find your styles.css file. You will write your media queries at the bottom of styles.css.

Use three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.

You use 980px because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.

768px is about the width of a tablet and 640px is about the width of a phone in landscape.

Make the layout match the following screenshots:
